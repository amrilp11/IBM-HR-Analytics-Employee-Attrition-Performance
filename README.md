# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance

IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance dataset from the Kaggle.

I've first done data exploratory analysis using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn.
Since this is a classification problem I've used Support Vector Classifier, desicion tree classifier, Logistic regression.
I've used GridSearchCV to try Permutationn and Combination with different values of hyper parameters for better accuracy.

Cheers,
Amril
